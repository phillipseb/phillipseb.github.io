title: "Impact of Women's Infertility on U.S. Birth Rates"
permalink: /infertility_analysis/

The idea and question of fertility has been a topic that I have been researching for some years now, especially
being a young woman. It has become more of a prevalent issue, at least in the United States, for women to
struggle with infertility and therefore not being able to have children naturally or maybe at all. In terms
of birth rates, I would think that the issue of reproductive health in women (and maybe even men) has an
impact on the number of kids that are born year-to-year in the country. Therefore, the problem that I wanted
to research was the problem of infertility in America and how it has impacted birth rate. In order for any
country’s population to grow, people need to be born, and it could have a huge impact on the population if
people experience issues with fertility and reproductive health. With the concept of infertility, I would also
like to research how various factors influence one’s fertility and whether we can predict the fertility of an
individual based on their demographic and environmental variables.
