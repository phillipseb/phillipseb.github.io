## Welcome to GitHub Pages

My name is Emily Phillips, and I am currently a Master's student at Bellevue University pursuing a degree in Data Science. I also work full-time as a data engineer at a financial services industry, and have gained experience in the building, processing and utilization of data pipelines, both on-premise and in the cloud. This degree has expanded my knowledge and skills beyond this now, and I can't wait to see what else is in store in the data world!

This portfolio is an accumulation of my course project work over the curriculum of 5 terms (10 classes). I am very excited to share my work with anyone who happens to come across this page, and welcome all feedback!
